			[Storing androidupload-keystore.jks]

			Warning:
			The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using "keytool -													importkeystore -srckeystore androidupload-keystore.jks -destkeystore androidupload-keystore.jks -deststoretype pkcs12".

			
			And upload-keystore.jks this file created in Andriod level

			And create the key.properties  and add this lines to that file 

					storePassword=<password-from-previous-step>
					keyPassword=<password-from-previous-step>
					keyAlias=upload
					storeFile=<keystore-file-location>

							def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
							def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
							if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
							    keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
							}
 						
 						And replace with buildTypes section the sign up configuration in andriod section 

								
							signingConfigs {
								release {
								    keyAlias = keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
								    keyPassword = keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
								    storeFile = keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
								    storePassword = keystoreProperties['storePassword']
								}
							    }
							    buildTypes {
								release {
								   
								    signingConfig = signingConfigs.release
								}
